# Deployment

Describes `package.json` scripts, `vite.config.ts`, and `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

## Local

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev       # Vite dev server
npm run build     # tsc -b && vite build → dist/
npm run preview   # serve dist/
npm run lint      # oxlint
```

Node 22 is what GitHub Actions uses (`actions/setup-node`).

## Asset base

`vite.config.ts` sets `base` to `./` for `vite build` and `/` for the dev server. The relative base lets one `dist/` work on GitHub project pages without hard-coding the repo name. The export does not fetch logos. The PRIME and webinar logos are hosted at `media.primeinc.org`, so the base path does not affect them. See `docs/dmu-output.md`.

## Synapse env

`npm run dev` reads these names from `.env.local`. `.env.example` lists the same names with empty values. Do not commit values.

| Name | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Synapse origin. Empty keeps the mock catalog |
| `VITE_API_CLIENT_ID` | Sent as `X-Client-Id` |
| `VITE_API_CLIENT_SECRET` | Sent as `X-Client-Secret` |
| `VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA` | `true` forces the mock catalog even when the base URL is set |

When the base URL is set, the dev server proxies paths starting with `/client` to that origin (`changeOrigin: true`). The browser calls that same-origin path. A production build calls the origin directly, because Vite inlines `VITE_` values at build time. Coolify must supply them to the build. Those values are present in the built JavaScript.

The GitHub Pages workflow does not set these variables, so that build uses the mock catalog.

## GitHub Pages

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds on push to `main` (and `workflow_dispatch`) and deploys `dist/` with `actions/deploy-pages`. This is the current static host for the mock app.

## Coolify

The intended host is Coolify, so the design team can use the app on a network that reaches Synapse. This repo has no Dockerfile, compose file, or Coolify definition yet.

When that host is added, update this doc in the same change with:

- the service type and the port Coolify should proxy
- how `dist/` is produced in the image or build pack
- any env vars (names only, never values)
- how the browser reaches Synapse (the origin supplied as `VITE_API_BASE_URL` at build time, not a public GitHub Pages origin)

GitHub Pages can keep serving the mock build. The Synapse-backed app belongs on Coolify, because those endpoints are internal.
