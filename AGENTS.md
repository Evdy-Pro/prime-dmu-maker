# DMU Maker

Internal app for PRIME Education's graphic design team. A DMU is the ad unit for a CME activity that runs on MedPage Today.

## Before changing the app

1. Read the doc for the area you are changing.
2. If the change would make a sentence in `docs/`, `README.md`, or this file false or incomplete, update that file in the same change.
3. Do not invent Synapse paths, auth, or payloads. Live calls are documented in `docs/activity-data.md`. The mock catalog in `src/services/mockDataService.ts` is used when `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is empty or `VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA` is `true`.

## Docs

| Area | Doc | Code |

| Activity shape, mock catalog, Synapse API | `docs/activity-data.md` | `src/types/dmu.ts`, `src/services/` |
